Here I have Implemented some derivative model in simple C++ without using any external libraries,which I had learnt from John Hull's Futures options and other derivatives and understood the mathematics from YouTube and blogs.

If there is anyone who wants to start self studing this book I reccomend start reading the book and follow Follow Khan Academy's lectures on this topic. Please feel free to put up a PR for new suggestions to learn this field.
